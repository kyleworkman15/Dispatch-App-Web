Directions (kind of) in case you don't know how to run the local html file on port 5000.

*Must have entire Git repository folder (because of the firebase.json file, etc)
*Also might need to download node.js (not sure if this is needed)

-cd into the directory
-run "firebase serve"
-go to "http://localhost:5000" in your web browser

Series of commands I use to run it:
